               shadow maps. Our technique uses a perspective transform
               specified in light space which allows treating all lights as
               directional lights and does not change the direction of the
               light sources. This gives all the benefits of the
               perspective mapping but avoids the problems inherent in
               perspective shadow mapping like singularities in
               post-perspective space, missed shadow casters etc.
               Furthermore, we show that both uniform and perspective
               shadow maps distribute the perspective aliasing error that
               occurs in shadow mapping unequally over the available depth
               range. We therefore propose a transform that equalizes this
               error and gives equally pleasing results for near and far
               viewing distances. Our method is simple to implement,
               requires no scene analysis and is therefore as fast as
               uniform shadow mapping.",

               and reduces the delays due to the latency of query results.
               We reuse the results of the occlusion queries from the last
               frame in order to initiate and schedule the queries in the
               next frame. This is done by processing nodes of a spatial
               hierarchy in front-to-back order, interleaving occlusion
               queries with the rendering of certain previously visible
               nodes. The proposed scheduling of the queries makes use of
               spatial and temporal coherence of visibility. Despite its
               simplicity, the algorithm achieves good culling efficiency
               for scenes of various characteristics. The implementation of
               the algorithm is straightforward, and it can be easily
               integrated in existing real-time rendering packages using
               various spatial data structures.",

  abstract =	"Many sophisticated solutions have been proposed to
		 reduce the geometric complexity of 3D meshes. A less
		 studied problem is how to preserve on a simplified mesh
		 the detail (e.g. color, high frequency shape detail,
		 scalar fields, etc.) which is encoded in the original
		 mesh. We present a general approach for preserving
		 detail on simplified meshes. The detail (or high
		 frequency information) lost after simplification is
		 encoded through texture or bump maps. The original
		 contribution is that preservation is performed after
		 simplification, by building set of triangular texture
		 patches that are then packed in a single texture map.
		 Each simplified mesh face is sampled to build the
		 associated triangular texture patch; a new method for
		 storing this set of texture patches into a standard
		 rectangular texture is presented and discussed. Our
		 detail preserving approach makes no assumptions about
		 the simplification process adopted to reduce mesh
		 complexity and allows highly efficient rendering. The
		 solution is very general, allowing preservation of any
		 attribute value defined on the high resolution mesh. We
		 also describe an alternative application: the
		 conversion of 3D models with 3D static procedural
		 textures into standard 3D models with 2D textures.",

	abstract = {This paper presents a real-time method to realistically render dynamic participating media under changing lighting conditions. In order to cope with performance requirements, the volume is built of instances of particle blocks. The simulation and rendering happen on two levels, on the block level and on the volume level. On the volume level blocks are replaced by depth impostors, which allows for very fast recalculation of the cloud illumination. Including depth information into block impostors our technique also eliminates billboard clipping artifacts when the participating medium contains objects. The proposed method can render swirling clouds and smoke on high frame rates, and can be used in real-time applications.}
