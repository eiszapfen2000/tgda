@article{article:Tucker1984Numerical,
    abstract = {A commonly used method of simulating ocean waves from a 
specified frequency spectrum is shown to be incorrect. The method consists of 
adding numerous sine curves with random phases; and the error arises from 
assuming that the amplitudes of these component sine waves are deterministic, 
when they are in fact random variables. Methods of using random amplitudes are 
described and only one is found to be satisfactory. In this method the number of 
random values simulated — and then transformed with an inverse FFT — equals the 
required number of simulated data points. So simulation in the frequency domain 
can only give relatively short runs; it is necessary to work in the time domain 
if arbitrarily long runs are required. Errors in wave group statistics derived 
from the incorrect simulation method are discussed and related to discrepancies 
reported between groupiness in simulated data and ocean measurements.},
