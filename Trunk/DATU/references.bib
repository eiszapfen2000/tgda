@article{article:CoxMunk1954,
    abstract = {{A method is developed for interpreting the statistics of the 
sun's glitter on the sea surface in terms of the statistics of the slope 
distribution. The method consists of two principal phases: (1) of identifying, 
from geometric considerations, any point on the surface with the particular 
slope required for the reflection of the sun's rays toward the observer; and (2) 
of interpreting the average brightness of the sea surface in the vicinity of 
this point in terms of the frequency with which this particular slope occurs. 
The computation of the probability of large (and infrequent) slopes is limited 
by the disappearance of the glitter into a background consisting of (1) the 
sunlight scattered from particles beneath the sea surface, and (2) the skylight 
reflected by the sea surface.The method has been applied to aerial photographs 
taken under carefully chosen conditions in the Hawaiian area. Winds were 
measured from a vessel at the time and place of the aerial photographs, and 
cover a range from 1 to 14 m sec-1. The effect of surface slicks, laid by the 
vessel, are included in the study. A two-dimensional Gram-Charlier series is 
fitted to the data. As a first approximation the distribution is Gaussian and 
isotropic with respect to direction. The mean square slope (regardless of 
direction) increases linearly with the wind speed, reaching a value of (tan 
16Ã‚Â°)2 for a wind speed of 14 m sec-1. The ratio of the up/downwind to the 
crosswind component of mean square slope varies from 1.0 to 1.9. There is some 
up/downwind skewness which increases with increasing wind speed. As a result the 
most probable slope at high winds is not zero but a few degrees, with the 
azimuth of ascent pointing downwind. The measured peakedness which is barely 
above the limit of observational error, is such as to make the probability of 
very large and very small slopes greater than Gaussian. The effect of oil slicks 
covering an area of one-quarter square mile is to reduce the mean square slopes 
by a factor of two or three, to eliminate skewness, but to leave peakedness 
unchanged.}},

  Abstract                 = {Two-dimensional wave slope spectra have been 
measured in the large Delft wind-wave facility using an imaging optical 
technique and digital image processing. The data cover wavelengths from 0.4 to 
24 cm and wind speeds (U 10) from 2.7 to 17.2 ms-1. The spectral densities of 
small gravity waves at higher wind speeds are proportional to k ^-3.5 and u*. 
Capillary-gravity and capillary waves show features which clearly manifest that 
the energy balance for these waves is much different from that for gravity 
waves. The degree of saturation is approximately constant at a given wind speed, 
but strongly increases with friction velocity (proportional to u*^2.5). A sharp 
cutoff, which is almost independent of the wind speed, occurs at a wavelength of 
about 7 mm.},

    abstract = {A commonly used method of simulating ocean waves from a 
specified frequency spectrum is shown to be incorrect. The method consists of 
adding numerous sine curves with random phases; and the error arises from 
assuming that the amplitudes of these component sine waves are deterministic, 
when they are in fact random variables. Methods of using random amplitudes are 
described and only one is found to be satisfactory. In this method the number of 
random values simulated Ã¢â‚¬â€ and then transformed with an inverse FFT Ã¢â‚¬â€ equals the 
required number of simulated data points. So simulation in the frequency domain 
can only give relatively short runs; it is necessary to work in the time domain 
if arbitrarily long runs are required. Errors in wave group statistics derived 
from the incorrect simulation method are discussed and related to discrepancies 
reported between groupiness in simulated data and ocean measurements.},
