The ocean surface is an intricate phenomenon which owes its complexity
to its highly dynamic nature. Be it a quiet sea or an agitated one, small
turbulent waves or huge breaking ones, the underlying mechanisms are manifold
and act on a variety of scales. Oceanographic research defines the behaviour of
an ocean surface based on its location. Water areas far from the coast are
called~\emph{the deep ocean}, water areas close to shore are called
\emph{shallow water}. Deep ocean surfaces are governed by the interaction of
wind and gravity at the interface between air and water, whereas shallow water
surfaces are characterized by waves breaking near the shore.\\

\section{Simulation}
%
To date, computer graphics employs several ocean wave models which may be
separated roughly into three families: parametric description, spectral
description, computational fluid dynamics. The first describes the water surface
by means of parametric equations which have been derived based on real world
observations \cite{Gerstner:1809}\cite{Rankine:1863}\cite{Biesel:1952}.
The second family approximate the ocean surface using wave spectra which
simulate the sea as a random process based on the distribution of wave energy
in frequency space \cite{book:kinsman2002wind}\cite{article:PiersonMoskowitz1964}
\cite{article:Hasselman1973}\cite{article:Donelan1985}\cite{article:Elfouhaily1997}.
Third, computational fluid dynamics and more specifically the Navier-Stokes
equations are able to fully describe the dynamics of all kinds of fluid,
including the ocean.

\subsection{Parametric Models}
%
The parametric models are generally bound to the spatial domain, where they
generate and animate the ocean surface by means of a sum of periodical functions
which are able to evolve throughout time.
The ocean surface may be represented as a heightmap
\begin{equation}
h(x,z,t) = y + \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \cos (l_j x + m_j z - \omega_j t)
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the mean height of the free surface, $n$ is the number of waves, $a_j$
is the amplitude of the jth wave, $\mvec{k}_j = (l_j, m_j)$ its wave vector,
and $\omega_j$ its angular frequency.
