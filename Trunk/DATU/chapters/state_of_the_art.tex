The ocean surface is an intricate phenomenon which owes its complexity
to its highly dynamic nature. Be it a quiet sea or an agitated one, small
turbulent waves or huge breaking ones, the underlying mechanisms are manifold
and act on a variety of scales. 
Surface tension, wind, earth's gravity, the gravitational pull of
sun and moon, all have an impact on ocean surface waves, where each force or
effect governs a different range of wavelengths.
Scientists have spent centuries trying to understand and explain these mechanisms.
%For example, ocean surface waves are in large
%part governed by the forces of wind and gravity, but capillary waves, often
%referred to as ripples, are dominated by surface tension, whereas tidal waves
%are caused by the gravitational pull of sun and moon. 
%with wavelengths less than a few centimeters and governed by surface tension, wind, storm, tsunami caused by earthquake, tidal waves
%
Oceanographic researchers define the behaviour of an ocean surface not based
on its influencing quantities, but based on its location. Water areas far from the
coast are called~\emph{deep water}, water areas close to shore are called
\emph{shallow water}, with \emph{intermediate} areas in between. Different
water locations are governed by different parameters. Deep ocean surfaces are
dominated by the interaction of wind and gravity at the interface
between air and water, whereas shallow water surfaces are characterized by waves
breaking near the shore. Deep water may ignore changes in water depth,
whereas intermediate and shallow waters need to account for how it affects
surface waves. Additionally, tidal waves and tsunamis may travel unnoticed
through deep water, but have a measurable impact on intermediate water areas
and even more so on shallow water areas.\\

% The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows:
% Section~\ref{sec:simulation} gives an overview of simulation techniques used in
% computer graphics to synthesize various types of ocean surfaces.
% Section~\ref{sec:rendering} on the other hand discusses a compact set of 
% realtime ocean surface rendering algorithms.

To date, computer graphics employs several ocean wave simulation models which
may be roughly separated into three families: parametric description, spectral
description, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The first describes the water
surface by means of parametric equations which have been derived based on real
world observations \citep{Gerstner:1809,Rankine:1863,Biesel:1952}.
The second family approximate the ocean surface using wave spectra which
simulate the sea as a random process based on the distribution of wave energy
in frequency space \citep{book:kinsman2002wind,article:PiersonMoskowitz1964,
article:Hasselman1973,article:Donelan1985,article:Elfouhaily1997}.
Third, computational fluid dynamics in combination with the Navier-Stokes
equations (NSE) are potentially able to fully describe the dynamics of all kinds of
fluid, including the ocean. We will omit any further discussion regarding CFD and NSE,
because, one, those models are the ones with the largest computational cost and therefore
the least adequate to simulate an entire ocean, and two,
the low degree of control over the simulation these algorithms allow for
may result in the user to be unable to get satisfactory results.
The interested reader may consult \cite{Bridson:2015} and \cite{egstar:2014} though.

Parametric models are generally bound to the spatial domain, where they
generate and animate the ocean surface by means of a sum of periodical functions
which evolve throughout time using a phase difference. One of the earliest works
in this realm of computer graphics has been done by~\citet{Max:1981}. The ocean
surface is represented as a height map, where for each point $(x,z)$ at time $t$
the height is computed as a sum of sinusoids:
\begin{equation}
h(x,z,t) = y + \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \cos (l_i x + m_i z - \omega_i t)
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the mean height of the free surface, $N$ is the number of waves,
$A_i$ is the amplitude of the $i$th wave, $\mvec{k}_i = (l_i, m_i)$ its wave
vector, and $\omega_i$ its angular frequency. The wave vector defines the
travelling direction of the wave, with the the positive X-axis pointing towards
the coastline, the Y-axis pointing in the opposite direction of earth's gravity,
and the Z-axis aligned with the coastline. For the sum of waves to achieve a
realistic shape, \citeauthor{Max:1981} applies linear wave theory \citep{book:airy1845tides}.
The waves on the water surface are assumed to be dominated by gravity, the wave
amplitudes are assumed to be small in relation to the size of the water body,
and the water body is assumed to have infinite depth. Then, according to linear
wave theory it follows that the wave number $k=\norm{\mvec{k}}$ and the angular
frequency $\omega$ are related by $\omega^2=kg$, where $g=9.81$ denotes earth's
gravity. Results obtained by~\citeauthor{Max:1981} are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:max1981}.

Both,~\cite{Schachter:1980} and~\cite{Perlin:1985}, developed similar approaches,
where instead of generating any actual geometry they simply distort the normal
vectors of given surfaces. Results obtained by~\citeauthor{Perlin:1985} are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:perlin1985}.

The assumption of infinite depth restricts the above methods to deep water, they
are unable to include phenomena which arise near the shore, such as breaking
waves and wave refraction. \cite{Peachey:1986}, still in the realm of linear
wave theory, simulates waves near the shore through the relationship
$\omega^2=kg\tanh (kh)$, where $h$ is the water depth. Moreover,
\citeauthor{Peachey:1986} distorts waves approaching the sloping beach so that
they resemble breaking waves more closely. Additionally, particle systems are
added to generate spray. Results of \cite{Peachey:1986} are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:peachey1986}.

\cite{Fournier:1986}, instead of using sinusoids, build on Gerstner's work
\citep{Gerstner:1809, Rankine:1863} to synthesize waves. Gerstner waves assume
a water surface dominated by gravity and an incompressible water body of
infinite depth. A single wave may be written as follows:
\begin{align}
\mvec{x} &= \mvec{x}_0 - \frac{\mvec{k}}{\norm{\mvec{k}}} A \sin\left(\mvec{k}\cdot\mvec{x}_0-\omega t\right)\\
y &= y_0 - A \cos\left(\mvec{k}\cdot\mvec{x}_0-\omega t\right)
\end{align}
where $\mvec{x}$ denotes the horizontal coordinate and $y$ the vertical coordinate
of the wave particle at time $t$, with $\mvec{x}_0$ and $y_0$ its horizontal
and vertical position at rest respectively. As before, $A$ is the amplitude,
$\mvec{k}$ the wave vector and $\omega$ the wave's angular frequency. Given the
wave number $k=\norm{\mvec{k}}$, the term $kA$ defines the sharpness of the wave
crest. With $kA<1$ the wave takes the form of an upside-down trochoid, with
$kA=1$ the form of an upside-down cycloid, and with $kA>1$ the wave intersects
itself, an undesireable effect which does not resemble real waves.
See Figure~\ref{fig:trochoid:crests} for waves with different $kA$.
%Gerstner waves take the form of an upside-down trochoid.
The sum of of Gerstner waves is as follows:
\begin{align}
\mvec{x} &= \mvec{x}_0 - \sum_i^N\frac{\mvec{k}_i}{\norm{\mvec{k_i}}} A_i \sin\left(\mvec{k}_i\cdot\mvec{x}_0-\omega t\right)\\
y &= y_0 - \sum_i^N A_i \cos\left(\mvec{k}_i\cdot\mvec{x}_0-\omega t\right)

\citeauthor{Fournier:1986} improve upon the above model in two ways. First, wave
particle motion takes the underlying sea bed into account, allowing for waves
to be refracted i.e. to change their wavelength, their speed and their direction
of travel based on water depth, see Figure~\ref{fig:fournier1986:refraction}.
Second, the circular orbit of Gerstner waves approaching the shore is
transformed into an elliptical orbit, which allows to approximate the form of
breaking waves near the beach. Results of \cite{Fournier:1986} are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:fournier1986:results}.

%
\cite{Ts'o:1987} implement an algorithm called \emph{wave tracing} which
launches orthogonal wave rays from the open sea along the direction of wave
propagation. Wave refraction is computed based on Snell's law, the wave trains
are traced inside a uniform grid. In case rays tracing the waves path diverge
significantly from a straight line, there may remain undersampled areas,
leading to parts of the surface lacking detail. \cite{Gonzato:1997} improve
upon this by generating new rays in undersampled areas, allowing their
\emph{dynamic wave tracing} algorithm to more densely sample the water surface
surrounding islands and the water surface inside bays. See Figure
\ref{fig:gonzato1997:results} for a comparison between wave tracing and
dynamic wave tracing. Moreover,
\citeauthor{Gonzato:1997} modify the wave model to include plunging breaking
waves. Three additional functions achieve said goal.
First, a stretch function which imitates Biesel law~\citep{Biesel:1952} by
progressively stretching the wave on the crest along its major axis. Second and
third, an orientation and a displacement function to rotate the wave's crest
downwards, towards the water surface below the crest. Later,
\citeauthor{Gonzato:2000} extend their work to include wave diffraction, see
\cite{Gonzato:2000}.\\

Parametric models are well suited to model propagating water fronts, where a
small number of wave numbers may suffice to obtain satisfactory results. 
Because one has basically to select the involved wave lengths and amplitudes
by trial and error, it follows that parametric models are not particularly
eligible to represent an agitated water surface, as it would involve a
significant higher number of waves. The user may have a hard time assembling a
meaningful number of wave numbers and amplitudes, with the result being
potentially infeasible because of the accumulated computational cost.

\section{Spectral Models}
Oceanographic research employs~\emph{wave spectra} to model the deep ocean. The
sea is assumed as a linear superposition of sinusoids with many different wave
lengths, frequencies and phases, travelling in different directions. The wave
spectrum gives the distribution of wave energy among different wave frequencies
or wave lengths. Given horizontal coordinate $\mvec{x}$, we may compute the
vertical coordinate via an inverse Discrete Fourier Transform as follows:
\begin{equation}
h(\mvec{x},t) = \sum_{\mvec{k}}A(\mvec{k},t)\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\transpose{\mvec{k}}\mvec{x}}
\label{eq:spectral_models}
\end{equation}
where $\mvec{k}$ represent the wave vectors of the most significant frequency
components, and $A(\mvec{k},t)$ are the amplitudes obtained from the wave
spectrum. At this point we refer to Sections \ref{sec:linear_theory_ocean_waves}
and \ref{sec:random_sea} for a more thorough discussion of the theoretical
background of wave spectra, whereas Section \ref{sec:random_sea_discretisation}
explains Equation~\ref{eq:spectral_models} in detail. For now it shall suffice
to give an overview of key properties of wave spectra. 

First, all wave spectra
are static. Static in the sense, that a wave spectrum represents a certain sea
state based on parameters such as wind speed and the distance from shore. To
change the sea state requires the synthesis of a new wave spectrum. Thus, for
example, if one would like to simulate a calm sea which gets agitated as a storm
approaches, then one needs to generate different wave spectra and interpolate
between them.

Second, wave spectra are compact models which require only a small
number of input parameters defining the desired sea state. Since wave spectra
are homogeneous models, all parameters are uniform for the entire ocean surface,
there is no room for local variations as parametric models would allow. Wave
spectra assume the ocean surface to be dominated by the interplay of wind and
gravity, hence wind speed is the parameter common to all models. Another well
established parameter is~\emph{fetch}, which is the distance over which the wind
blows before it reaches the ocean patch the wave spectrum simulates. Water
depth, if supported by the wave spectrum model, like all other parameters is
uniform, hence the sea bed is assumed planar and parallel to the ocean surface
at rest. It follows that no wave transitions from one water depth to another,
therefore no wave refraction may take place.

Third, the inverse Discrete Fourier Transform may leverage the
Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, which makes the computation of
Equation~\ref{eq:spectral_models} most efficient. Hence, given the same
computational cost, it is possible for spectral models to involve way more wave
numbers in the sum of waves than parametric models could. Moreover, thanks to
the Discrete Fourier Transform we get a seamless tileable surface.
The downside of the Fourier Transform is that the range and uniform sampling
density of spatial coordinates $\mvec{x}$ directly defines the set of wave
vectors $\mvec{k}$ contributing to the sum of waves. In contrast to the
parametric models we are neither able to cherry-pick certain wave vectors,
nor to omit a range of wave vectors, nor to to exert some form of local control
where we modify the set of wave vectors based on location $\mvec{x}$.\\

%
\cite{Mastin:1987} introduced wave spectra to computer graphics. Their approach
is a simple one: generate white noise to represent random amplitudes and phases,
then filter it with the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum
\citep{article:PiersonMoskowitz1964} in frequency space. The Pierson-Moskowitz
spectrum gives wave energy per wave number, but not its distribution across
wave vectors. In short, there is no information telling in which direction the
waves are moving. Thus, \citeauthor{Mastin:1987} combine the Pierson-Moskowitz
spectrum with a \emph{directional spreading function}, namely the one proposed
in \cite{article:Hasselmann1980}. A directional
spreading function distributes wave energy across wave vectors, where
the energy peak is usually to be found aligned with the wind direction and the
remaining energy fanning out at its sides. Results of \cite{Mastin:1987} are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mastin_waves}.
\cite{Premoze:2000} on the other hand make use of the JONSWAP spectrum
\citep{article:Hasselman1973}, as it allows for more varied ocean surfaces than
the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum.
An in-depth discussion of the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, the JONSWAP spectrum,
as well as directional spreading functions is to be found in Section
\ref{sec:1d_frequency_spectra}.

One of the most known works in computer graphics related to wave spectra is
\cite{course:simulatingocean}. Therein, \citeauthor{course:simulatingocean}
describes how the ocean was brought to life for productions such as
\emph{Waterworld} and \emph{Titanic}. In contrast to \citeauthor{Mastin:1987},
\citeauthor{course:simulatingocean} does not use white noise, but Gaussian
random numbers, because waves in deep sea areas are often observed to follow a
Gaussian distribution. Moreover, \citeauthor{course:simulatingocean}
makes use of the Phillips spectrum, a spectrum not found in oceanographic
research, but devised by himself specifically for computer graphics purposes.
%\cite{article:Phillips1958,article:Phillips1985}
Ocean surfaces based on wave spectra all share the same issue, namely the all to
gentle form of wave troughs and wave crests. Because the surface is computed as
a linear superposition of sinusoids, it is only natural that the result shares
the general form of its underlying building blocks. But a sea exposed to strong
winds or even a storm is characterized by steep waves with sharp crests.
\cite{course:simulatingocean} presents the~\emph{choppy wave} algorithm which
overcomes this specific issue by allowing the waves to take a form similar to
Gerstner waves, with deep troughs and sharp crests, see Figure
\ref{fig:tessendorf_choppy_waves}.
Section \ref{sec:phillips_spectrum} gives a detailed discussion of the Phillips
spectrum and its shortcomings compared to wave spectra from oceanographic
research. Section \ref{sec:displacements} on the other hand describes the choppy
wave algorithm.

\section{Hybrid Approaches}
Hybrid approaches combine parametric and spectral models, where wave spectra
provide a realistic description of the wave components, and the parametric part
allows fine-grained control over the model.
\citeauthor{Thon:2000}\citep{Thon:2000,Thon:2002} uses a linear superposition
of Gerstner waves, where a small set of wave vectors and corresponding
amplitudes is picked from a directional Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. Said wave
vectors need to be representative for a large part of the energy of the
spectrum, thus it is unlikely for short wavelengths to be selected. As a remedy,
a three dimensional turbulence function \citep{Perlin:1985} is added to generate
small scale details. \cite{lee:2007} improve upon the work of
\citeauthor{Thon:2000} by using the TMA spectrum~\citep{Hughes:1984} which
incorporates both, deep water waves and basic support for shallow water waves.
\cite{article:frechot2007} presents an adaptive sampling scheme, where care is
taken not only to include wave vectors with the most contribution to wave
energy, but wave vectors which are representative for the entire spectrum:
long waves, short waves and even capillary waves.

\section{GPU Implementations}
To obtain interactive framerates~\cite{Schneider:2001} simulate the displacements
caused by wave motion using Perlin noise in a vertex shader on the GPU.
\cite{Isidoro:2002} on the other hand perturb an existing mesh by means
of a sum of four sinusoids computed on the GPU. In addition ripples are generated
by a dynamic combination of multiple bumpmaps. In a similar fashion,
\cite{Chen:2007} employ a sum of four sinusoids to synthesize ripples on
an existing mesh. \cite{Finch:2004} uses a sum of four Gerstner waves to
displace an existing mesh, where wavelengths that are too short to be
represented by the mesh are filtered out automatically. Moreover,
\citeauthor{Finch:2004} evaluates an additional sum, with more waves involved,
to generate detailed surface normals.

\cite{Salgado:2007} present a simplified implementation
of \cite{Fournier:1986} using vertex shaders.
