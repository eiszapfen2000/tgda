\section{Structure of the Master's Thesis}

If the curriculum regulates the language of the master's thesis to be English (like for ``Business Informatics''), the thesis has to be written in English. Otherwise, the master's thesis may be written in English or in German. The structure of the thesis is predetermined.
The table of contents is followed by the introduction and the main part, which can vary according to the content. The master's thesis ends with the bibliography (compulsory) and the appendix (optional).
