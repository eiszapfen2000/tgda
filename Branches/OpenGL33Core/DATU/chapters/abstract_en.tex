The synthesis of a believable depiction of the ocean surface is a permanent
topic of interest in computer graphics. It represents even more of a
challenge for applications which require the real-time display of a water
body as large as the ocean.
That is because the ocean is a highly dynamic system which combines waves
at all scales, ranging from millimetres to kilometres. Moreover, the
ocean may be observed from several distances, ranging from close-ups
to views which reach the horizon. 
%To complicate matters further, the
%ocean is illuminated by natural light sources, such as the sun and the
%sky, which are dynamic by nature too.
We present a framework for the generation and rendering of the
open ocean in real-time, including waves at all scales, and arbitrary
viewing distances. We focus our efforts on the geometry of the animated
ocean surface, for which we leverage a set of wave spectrum models from
oceanographic research. We discuss the intricacies of
said models, as well as their fitness for real-time rendering. Moreover,
we delineate in detail how to integrate distinct wave spectrum models into a
coherent framework, from which one is able obtain believable, consistent
and coherent results.

%Realistic animation and rendering of the ocean is an important aspect for simulators, movies and video games.
%By nature, the ocean is a difficult problem for Computer Graphics: it is a dynamic system, it combines wave trains
%at all scales, ranging from kilometric to millimetric. Worse, the ocean is usually viewed at several distances, from
%very close to the viewpoint to the horizon, increasing the multi-scale issue, and resulting in aliasing problems. The
%illumination comes from natural light sources (the Sun and the sky dome), is also dynamic, and often underlines
%the aliasing issues. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for modelling, animation, illumination and rendering
%of the ocean, in real-time, at all scales and for all viewing distances. Our algorithm is based on a hierarchical
%representation, combining geometry, normals and BRDF. For each viewing distance, we compute a simplified
%version of the geometry, and encode the missing details into the normal and the BRDF, depending on the level of
%detail required. We then use this hierarchical representation for illumination and rendering. Our algorithm runs
%in real-time, and produces highly realistic pictures and animations.

%Natural phenomena are a permanent topic of interest for computer graphics researchers and enthusiasts. To synthesise a believable
%depiction of an ocean surface is a complex task, especially in realtime rendering. The first part of our work will discuss the
%challenges posed by the task at hand, and discuss a variety of current approaches to the problem. The second part will present
%our give an
%overview of the underlying wave theory as well as the different oceanographic models employed in this work.
