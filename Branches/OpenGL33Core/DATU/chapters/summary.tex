\chapter{Summary}
\label{ch:summary}

We stated in the introduction that in this work we seek to generate and render the
open ocean in real-time. Moreover, we aim for an ocean surface which does not only
look visually pleasing, but also believable to the observer. Given that context,
we chose to focus our efforts on wave geometry, because no lighting algorithm
is able to make good on unrealistic wave shapes.

For the purpose of ocean surface synthesis we opted for the approach by
\citet{course:simulatingocean}, where the perturbations produced
by the water surface are approximated by sampling the wave spectrum via
the \FastFourierTransform algorithm. The \FFT algorithm is highly
efficient and has the additional advantage of generating a perturbation
pattern which is able to seamlessly tile the ocean surface.
An additional upside of the wave spectrum approach is that oceanographic
research includes a wide range of wave spectra which are specifically
tailored to the deep water of the open ocean. Said wave spectra are
employed for oceanographic forecasts and simulations, therefore they
provide a high degree of realism.
Thus, we chose to implement four such wave energy spectra,
%\citep{article:PiersonMoskowitz1964, article:Hasselman1973, article:Donelan1985, article:Elfouhaily1997}, \citep{course:simulatingocean}
all well established in oceanographic literature, plus one wave
spectrum which stems from computer graphics (Section~\ref{sec:wave_spectra}).
The latter spectrum was unable to produce results which meet the high
standard given by the other spectra, and therefore we dropped it
(Section \ref{sec:phillips_spectrum} and \ref{sec:results:synthesis}).
The remaining four spectra, on the other hand, allowed us to obtain
animated wave geometry at the level of quality we sought after,
but only after we had made sure that each wave spectrum had been converted
to the correct integral domain (Section~\ref{subsec:integral_domain_conversion}).

For the purpose of ocean surface lighting we decided to implement the
algorithm by \citet{article:whitecaps}, as it gives believable results
and has been specifically tailored to the open ocean as represented by
wave spectra. After a successful implementation it turned out that only
two of our remaining wave spectra were able to unconditionally match
the algorithms stringent requirements, with a third spectrum keeping
up under most conditions (Section~\ref{sec:results:lighting}).

With ocean surface synthesis and lighting at hand, we have found that
as long as we employ only one perturbation pattern, we may not
be able to reproduce a high-quality ocean surface for all possible
viewing situations. Depending on the observer's viewpoint, we may be
faced with tiling artifacts or lack of detail.
Therefore we adopted the approach by~\citet{misc:oceanlightingfft},
which addresses the matter by superimposing multiple, complementary perturbation
patterns of different size (Section~\ref{sec:level_of_detail}).
With multiple patterns at hand, where each pattern consists of up to nine
separate spectra, pattern generation had become computationally too
expensive to still allow for real-time operation.
Therefore we took a number of measures to restore real-time behaviour.
First, we split surface synthesis into two separate threads, where the first
one generates the pattern's actual spectra, and the second one
applies the \InvDiscreteFourierTransform on said spectra (Section~\ref{sec:demo_application}).
%First, we moved pattern generation as well as 
%and transformation via \FFT to separate threads each (Section~\ref{sec:demo_application}).
Second, as the spectrum consists of a static part and a time-dependent part,
we made sure to compute only the time-dependent part of the spectrum for each
frame (Section~\ref{sec:spectrum_synthesis}).
Third, as all of our spectra are hermitian, we compute the \InvFourierTransform
of two spectra at once (Section~\ref{sec:discrete_fourier_transform}).
%Hence,
%we were able to reduce the maximum number of \InvFourierTransforms per pattern
%from nine to five.
Fourth, we switched the \InvFourierTransform from double precision to single
precision, accelerating its computation by a factor of two
(Section~\ref{sec:performance:fft}).

With performance back to real-time framerates, we enhanced the work by
\citet{misc:oceanlightingfft} with a multi-resolution variant, where
the water surface's wave geometry may be synthesized at a lower resolution
than its respective normal vectors and whitecaps
(Section~\ref{sec:implementation:multires}).
The reduced resolution lead to an improvement in performance, but not to a
significant degradation in visual quality of the result, at least not for
a large range of distinct scenes (Section~\ref{sec:results:fidelity}).
%For a large range of distinct scenes the reduced resolution did not seem
%to degrade visual quality in a significant way.
Thus we decided to permanently keep the multi-resolution approach, as it
allows for a more fine-grained balance between model detail and performance.
%

%Furthermore, we implemented the lighting algorithm by \cite{article:whitecaps},
%which has been specifically tailored to wave spectra.

%
%
%Thus we are given the
%means to further improve performance by 
%
%The latter approach
%allowed us for a more fine-grained balance between model detail and performance. 

%Naturally, multiple patterns imply an increase in computational cost of
%pattern generation. To still be able to generate the ocean surface in
%real-time
%
%With only one perturbation pattern at hand, one may be faced with tiling
%artifacts or lack of detail, depending on the observer's viewpoint.


%First, discretisation and multiple patterns, for proper sampling. Then,
%hermitian spectra to improve performance. Then multi-resolution, again,
%for performance.

%Ocean lighting scheme tailored to the above (Bruneton, Dupuy), another spectrum
%disqualified.

%With our goal being to render the open ocean, we found that discretisation
%of the wave spectrum had proven to be an issue, as we were not sampling enough
%distinct \wavenumbers to reproduce a high-quality ocean surface for all
%possible viewing situations. We addressed the matter by using multiple,
%complementary wave patterns which sample different, non-overlapping parts
%of the wave spectrum. During this work, up to four of such patterns where
%always sufficient.

%but only after we made sure to meet a set of preconditions. First and
%foremost, we had to ensure that each wave spectrum of interest is
%converted to the correct integral domain. Second,  
%
%Wave energy spectrum from oceanographic research provides realistic wave geometry
%and animation, given integral domain conversion is done correctly.
%Discretisation is an issue, addressed by additional levels of detail.

\section{Future Work}
The work presented in this thesis leaves room for improvement on several fronts.

One could take the next step in ocean surface synthesis and implement support
for wave energy spectra which are able to model shallow water, such as the
TMA spectrum \citep{Hughes:1984}. In that case, one would be required to
incorporate a dispersion relation which models both shallow and deep water,
including the necessary follow-up work to adapt the wave energy spectrum's
integral domain conversions to the new dispersion relation~\citep{Horvath:2015}.
%Moreover, one would have to adapt the wave energy integral scaling to match said dispersion relation.

Wave spectra aside, one could significantly improve upon performance by
following the lead of \cite{misc:oceanlightingfft} and generate all
pattern datasets on the GPU, as well as compute all \InvDiscreteFourierTransforms
on the GPU, while the static part of the underlying wave energy spectrum
would still be synthesized on the CPU. Additionally, it would beneficial
to look for a viable alternative to rendering whitecaps, as the approach
by \citet{article:whitecaps} is computationally highly expensive,
especially with regard to pattern dataset synthesis.

%For performance reasons it would be highly beneficial to follow the lead of
%\cite{misc:oceanlightingfft} and generate all pattern datasets on the GPU,
%as well as compute all \InvDiscreteFourierTransforms on the GPU, while the
%underlying wave energy spectrum Equation~\ref{eq:dft_h0_k} could still be synthesized on the CPU.

Last, to better balance performance and visual fidelity, one could allow
for more fine-grained control over pattern resolutions, as it may be
of advantage to be able to configure the resolution for each dataset for
each pattern separately.
