We stated in the introduction that in this work we seek to generate and render the
open ocean in real-time. Moreover, we aim for an ocean surface which does not only
look visually pleasing, but also believable to the observer. Given that context,
we chose to focus our efforts on wave geometry, because no lighting algorithm
is able to make good on unrealistic wave shapes.

For the purpose of ocean surface synthesis we opted for a wave spectrum
based approach, as oceanographic research provides a wide range of wave
energy spectra which are tailored to the deep water of the open ocean.
Because wave spectra are employed for oceanographic forecasts and
simulations, they provide a high degree of realism.
We chose to implement four such wave energy spectra, all well established
in oceanographic literature, plus one wave spectrum from computer graphics literature. The latter was unable to give results consistent in quality
with the other four spectra, and thus we dropped it. 
The remaining four spectra, on the other hand, allowed us to attain
animated wave geometry at the level of quality we sought after,
but only after we had made sure that each wave spectrum had been converted
to the correct integral domain.

With our goal being to render the open ocean, we found that discretisation
of the wave spectrum had proven to be an issue, as we were not sampling enough
distinct \wavenumbers to reproduce a high-quality ocean surface for all
possible viewing situations. We addressed the matter by using multiple,
complementary wave patterns which sample different, non-overlapping parts
of the wave spectrum. During this work, up to four of such patterns where
always sufficient.

%foremost, we had to ensure that each wave spectrum of interest is
%converted to the correct integral domain. Second,  

Wave energy spectrum from oceanographic research provides realistic wave geometry
and animation, given integral domain conversion is done correctly.

\section{Future Work}
The work presented in this thesis leaves room for improvement on several fronts.

One could take the next step in ocean surface synthesis and implement support
for wave energy spectra which are able to model shallow water, such as the
TMA spectrum \citep{Hughes:1984}. In that case, one would be required to
incorporate a dispersion relation which models both shallow and deep water,
including the necessary follow-up work to adapt the wave energy spectrum's
integral domain conversions to the new dispersion relation~\citep{Horvath:2015}.
%Moreover, one would have to adapt the wave energy integral scaling to match said dispersion relation.

Wave spectra aside, one could significantly improve upon performance by
following the lead of \cite{misc:oceanlightingfft} and generate all
pattern datasets on the GPU, as well as compute all \InvDiscreteFourierTransforms
on the GPU, while the static part of the underlying wave energy spectrum
would still be synthesized on the CPU. Additionally, it would beneficial
to look for a viable alternative to rendering whitecaps, as the approach
by \citet{article:whitecaps} is computationally highly expensive,
especially with regard to pattern dataset synthesis.

%For performance reasons it would be highly beneficial to follow the lead of
%\cite{misc:oceanlightingfft} and generate all pattern datasets on the GPU,
%as well as compute all \InvDiscreteFourierTransforms on the GPU, while the
%underlying wave energy spectrum Equation~\ref{eq:dft_h0_k} could still be synthesized on the CPU.

Last, to better balance performance and visual fidelity, one could allow
for more fine-grained control over pattern resolutions, as it may be
of advantage to be able to configure the resolution for each dataset for
each pattern separately.
